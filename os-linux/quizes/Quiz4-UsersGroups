Answers and Explanations
Part A: Multiple Choice

1.
Which file stores encrypted user passwords on a modern Linux system?
Answer: b) /etc/shadow

Answer: cat /etc/passwd

15.

Answer: groups or id

Part D: Short Answer / Conceptual

16.
Explain the difference between primary and secondary groups.
Answer: Primary group is the default group assigned to a user (GID in /etc/passwd), used for newly created files. Secondary groups are additional groups the user belongs to, giving extra permissions.

17.
Why is /etc/shadow more secure than /etc/passwd?
Answer: /etc/shadow is readable only by root and stores encrypted passwords. /etc/passwd is world-readable and should not store actual passwords.

18.
Describe the purpose of sudo and when it should be used.
Answer: sudo allows a permitted user to execute commands as another user, usually root, for administrative tasks. It is used to avoid logging in as root directly, improving security.

19.
Name one special type of user in Linux and its purpose.
Answer: root – the superuser with full system privileges.
Other examples: nobody (limited permissions), service users (www-data, mysql).

20.
What happens if you assign UID 0 to a non-root user?
Answer: That user becomes equivalent to root, with full administrative privileges. This can compromise security.
