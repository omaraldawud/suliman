Find all files of user root that are in the directory /var
and were modified within the last 24 hours

 sudo find /var -user root -mtime -1

Explanation:
    sudo - run with superuser privileges (needed to access root-owned files)
    find - the command to search for files
    /var - the directory to search in
    -user root - files owned by user "root"
    -mtime -1 - files modified less than 1 day ago (within last 24 hours)
    This will list all files in /var owned by root that were modified within the last 24 hours.

Find all files in /var/log that are larger than 512KiB and
write that list to a file “big.list” in your home directory

        find /var/log -type f -size +512k > ~/big.list

Explanation:
    find /var/log - search in the /var/log directory
    -type f - look for regular files (not directories)
    -size +512k - files larger than 512 kilobytes
    > - redirect the output
    ~/big.list - to the file big.list in your home directory

The list of matching files will be saved to big.list in your home directory.

Find all files in /opt/share larger then 2MB and copy
them to your homefolder?

        find /opt/share -type f -size +2M -exec cp {} ~ \;

Explanation:
    find /opt/share - search in the /opt/share directory
    -type f - look for regular files (not directories)
    -size +2M - files larger than 2 megabytes
    -exec cp {} ~ \; - execute the cp command for each found file, where {} is replaced with the filename, and copy it to the home directory (~)

This will copy all files larger than 2MB from /opt/share to your home folder.
