Linux Software Management Quiz
Topics: Packages and repositories, dnf package manager, rpm commands

Think of Linux software management like app stores for your phone, but with superpowers! Instead of one store, Linux has different "systems" depending on your distribution (distro).

dnf command options:
    sudo dnf install <package_name> --> dnf install chrome
    sudo dnf remove <package_name>  --> dnf remove game 
    sudo dnf update                 --> dnf uopdate
    sudo dnf upgrade

NGINX "engine-x - web server
    sudo dnf install nginx      # Install it
    sudo systemctl start nginx  # Start it
    sudo systemctl enable nginx # Auto-start on boot
    sudo systemctl status nginx # Check if running

DNF vs RPM:
    # DNF (SMART - handles dependencies automatically)
        dnf install nginx
        # DNF will: 1) Find nginx.rpm, 2) Find ALL dependency .rpms, 3) Install everything

    # RPM (DUMB - just installs what you give it)
        rpm -ivh nginx.rpm
        # RPM will: 1) Install only nginx.rpm, 2) FAIL if dependencies missing

Answer Key
1. b) A remote or local collection of software packages
Explanation:
    A repository is a structured storage location (online or local) that contains software packages and metadata used by package managers like dnf.
--------
2. c) dnf update
Explanation:
    dnf update checks enabled repositories, resolves dependencies, and upgrades installed packages to newer versions.

--------
3. b) dnf list installed
Explanation:
    dnf list → all available packages
    dnf list installed → only packages currently installed on the system

--------
4. c) Searches repositories for nginx
Explanation:
    This command searches enabled repositories for package names and descriptions that match the keyword nginx.

--------
5. c) rpm -e
Explanation:
    -i → install
    -e → erase (remove)
    -qf → query file owner

--------
6. True
Explanation:
    dnf installs required dependencies automatically, which is why it is preferred over raw rpm.

--------
7. False (rpm works with local packages only)
Explanation:
    rpm only works with local .rpm files. It does not fetch packages from repositories.

--------
8. True
Explanation:
    dnf history displays a transaction log including installs, removals, upgrades, and rollbacks.

--------
9. True
Explanation:
    rpm -qf /path/to/file tells you which installed package provided that file.

--------
10. False (rpm does not resolve dependencies)
Explanation:
Unlike dnf, rpm does not handle dependency resolution. It may break the system if used incorrectly.

----------------    Part C: Practical / Command Questions ----------------
11. sudo dnf install httpd
Explanation:
    Uses dnf to download the package from a repository and install it with dependencies.

--------
12. sudo dnf remove nano
Explanation:
    dnf remove safely removes the package and any unneeded dependencies.

--------
13. dnf info bash
Explanation:
    Shows version, repository, size, description, and installed status.

--------
14. dnf history
Explanation:
    Lists all dnf operations with transaction IDs, dates, and actions.

--------
15. rpm -qf /usr/bin/passwd
Explanation:
    This is a common troubleshooting command to identify which package installed a specific file.
